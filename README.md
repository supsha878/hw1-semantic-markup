## Description

Accessibility is a topic of increasing priority on the internet. The internet should be accessible to everyone, so our goal as web developers is to use our tools to let anyone access the content in our webpages.....

**Goal:** To refactor website to meet accessibility standards. Must be optimized for search engines.

## Refactor

1. Replaced `<div>` and `<span>` elements with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<bdi>`, etc. Left class and id attributes that detailed content.
1. Cleaned CSS. Collapsed repetitive selectors and attributes. Organized selectors to reflect web page layout.
